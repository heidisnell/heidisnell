### :octocat: Hey I'm Heidi!

<p>I'm a Lab Automation Engineer for <a href="https://www.tempus.com/">Tempus</a> looking to get more involved in software development and open source projects. I am eager to learn new technologies and solve hard problems.</p>

<p>I use JavaScript/HTML/CSS with Google Apps Scripts for my day job, and am currently learning Typescript, Node.js, and React.</p>
