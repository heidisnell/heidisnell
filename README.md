### :octocat: Hey I'm Heidi!

<p>I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer for <a href="https://www.trimble.com/en/">Trimble</a> looking to get more involved in software development and open source projects. I am eager to learn new technologies and solve hard problems.</p>

<p>I have professional experience with JavaScript/CSS/HTML, and casual experience with TypeScript/React/Node.js.</p>

<p>My more recent work is over on Bitbucket and is mostly Java.</p>

<p>Add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-m-snell/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
